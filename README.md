# Quarter Shader
Very basic fragment shader for the Quarter site. Using twgl.js to make the WebGL implementation a little lighter.

The fragment shader is currently calculating a ton of noise on the fly. Ideally it would be baked into a texture instead to make it a little lighter on the client.

This wouldn't exist without the work of the generous people who shared their code on Shadertoy.
